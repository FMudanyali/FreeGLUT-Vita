# Freeglut for Vita
Freeglut library ported to vita using [Pigs-In-A-Blanket](https://github.com/SonicMastr/Pigs-In-A-Blanket).

## To compile for DolceSDK:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DVITA=1
make -j8
make install
```
## To-Do
The controls need work as I didn't try porting a glut game to see how the controls are used.
